# Curve Finance

Curve gives users & protocols the ability to exchange stablecoins with low fees and low slippage. Users can also provide liquidity and receive high-APR rewards for providing liquidity to the protocol.  Curve is a major protocol in the DeFi space, and we are excited to welcome them to the xDai stable ecosystem!

## Curve Basics

{% hint style="info" %}
See the [Curve docs](https://resources.curve.fi/) for basics on exchanging stable coins and depositing / withdrawing liquidity from the protocol.
{% endhint %}

## Connect with MetaMask

1\) If you haven't added the xDai chain to MetaMask, [follow these instructions](../../for-users/wallets/metamask/metamask-setup.md) to setup and switch to the xDai Network.

2\) You will need a little xDai to pay for transactions. You [can get some automatically by bridging assets to xDai, from the xDai faucet, purchase with fiat or in other ways](../../for-users/getting-started-with-xdai.md#2-get-a-little-xdai).

3\) Go to the Curve site at [https://xdai.curve.fi](https://xdai.curve.fi/pools). Click **Connect Wallet** and confirm the xDai address in MetaMask you want to use with Curve.

## Swap using Curve Pools

From the homepage, you will see the option to swap using existing pools.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/existing-pools-1.png)

**1\) Select the following**_**:**_

1. The coin you want to swap from.
2. The amount to swap.
3.  The asset you wish to receive. The amount will autopopulate, along with the exchange rate/fees and pool the trade will be routed through.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note, for **DAI you will need to use wrapped xDai**, not standard xDai. The easiest way to convert Dai to wxDai is with [wrapeth](https://wrapeth.com/).  
[_Additional info about wrapped xDai_](../../for-developers/developer-resources/wrapped-xdai.md)_._ 
{% endhint %}

2\) Click **Sell** to process. You will sign 2 transactions in MetaMask. The first to approve the contract, and the second to pay for the transaction.  You can adjust the gas price based on the [BlockScout Gas Tracker](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai).

![Transaction 1 Click Sell \| Confirm Contract](../../.gitbook/assets/tx-1.png)

![Transaction 2 Adjust Gas Price \| Confirm Transaction](../../.gitbook/assets/tx-2.png)

![Gas Tracker on BlockScout. Click \(i\) to expand](../../.gitbook/assets/gas-tracker.png)

3\) Find the transaction in MetaMask under the Activity Tab. Click icon in details to View the tx in BlockScout.
